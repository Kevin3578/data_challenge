# data_challenge

1. Download the Android and iOS app datasets from Kaggle
    - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gauthamp10/apple-appstore-apps
    - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gauthamp10/google-playstore-apps

2. Place the two downloaded files, appleAppData.csv, and Google-Playstore.csv into the same folder as data_challenge.py

3. In a terminal, cd into the same directory as requirements.txt and run `pip install -r requirements.txt`

4. Run data_challenge.py in python with `python data_challenge.py`. Your python install may be aliased to something else like `python3`

5. Plots should be generated and data should also be printed to the console. The plots on the top are the distribution of app sizes for games, music and health & fitness apps. The plots on the bottom are number of apps released each month for each respective category.

The data that is printed to the console are the largest apps released each year for each respective category along with the average rating of all apps for each category.

Included are a plots.png file to show an example of the plots generated and a stdout.txt to show an example of the console output.
